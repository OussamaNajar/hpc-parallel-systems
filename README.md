# Parallel MPI Systems

High-performance parallel computing implementations focused on MPI-based distributed-memory 
parallelism, communication-pattern analysis, and strong-scaling evaluation on HPC clusters.

## Projects

### MPI Game of Life (Fortran 90 + MPI)

Parallel implementations of Conway's Game of Life using MPI to study domain decomposition, 
communication overhead, and strong-scaling behavior on distributed-memory systems.

**The focus is not the cellular automaton itself**, but understanding how algorithmic structure, 
data movement, and communication patterns constrain performance at scale.

**Implementations:**
- Serial baseline for correctness validation and reference timing
- Row-wise domain decomposition (contiguous row blocks)
- Column-wise domain decomposition (contiguous column blocks)
- 2D block decomposition for larger-scale communication stress testing
- Performance instrumentation (latency measurement, computation timing)

**Execution Environment:**
- SLURM-managed HPC cluster
- Tested across 2–8 MPI ranks
- Grid sizes ranging from 20×20 to 2048×2048

**Key Findings (2048×2048 grid, 300 steps, output disabled; mean of 3 runs):**
- Achieved up to **4.24×** strong-scaling speedup on **8 MPI ranks** (column decomposition)
- Efficiency remained ~94–97% through 4 ranks, then dropped to ~46–53% at 8 ranks as communication dominated
- Communication fraction rose from ~1% (2 ranks) to ~41–44% (8 ranks)
- Observed superlinear speedup at 2 ranks, consistent with cache effects

**Code:** `MPI_game_of_life/`  
**Build:** `cd MPI_game_of_life && make -f scripts/Makefile all`  
**Run:** `cd MPI_game_of_life && mpirun -np 4 ./bin/row 2048 2048 300 0`
